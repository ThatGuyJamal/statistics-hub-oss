## `Self Hosting Guide`

I highly recommend using the live version of the bot and not self hosting. I will not prove detailed information or tech support
if something goes wrong in the process. While being open source, and free to use and published under the [GNU](./LICENSE) Public License I will help you get
started with the bot.

### `Requirements`

1.  ‚≠êStar this repository to show some support.

2.  Have Nodejs installed on your computer. With version 17.0.0 or higher.

3.  Go to mongodb.com and create a database, then save the connection url.

4.  Clone this repository, and rename the example.config.ts file to config.ts and fill it out.

5.  Install the dependency's and then compile the code using `yarn compile`.

6.  Lastly you can run the bot using `yarn start`.&#x20;

### `Important Notes`

1. Because of the lack of support moving forward with many message based commands from both the discord api and library's, the bot has limited support for things
   such as a custom prefix and message commands. You can implement this yourself but just know it had no been implemented fully. _And will be removed in the future._

2. As of now, the current version of the bot is being updated rapidly and is not in a stable version. It is also being developed to be a multi-guild bot in mind, meaning you may want to disabled or enable some of the features depending on your needs.
